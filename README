Welcome to my first GitHub project.

I have used some basic JS and PHP to access the Itunes search API and bring back 
relevant results based on simple inputs like the page title.


I built this as a way of quick workaround untill I configured a rather over complicated template of mine 
to provide itunes "id"s, but figured this could cme in handy for quite a few blggers. 

I am also using it to learn my way aroung the Git system, CMD Line and tools.

I invite anyone to contribute... I will spend a some time to make the code less suited to my personal environment 
and more welcoming to others, where more server limitationand web knowledge are at the users hand.

The aim is to make concise easy to use code that any blgger could attach to his/her and possibly help them make 
some money for their hard earned time.

Fork at will.


TO get starte dwith using and modifying the script you can just place these files in the root of your site and 
include the test.php in your template file.
